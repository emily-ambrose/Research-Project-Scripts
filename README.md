# Research Project Scripts
These scripts are for the genetic mapping of loci associated with endosymbionts using unmapped host sequencing reads.

The scripts included are just for the Temperate sample. Therefore, if carrying out on another sample, substitute 'Temperate' for the new sample name. This could be done using something like sed substitute. Paths will need to be changed accordingly.
